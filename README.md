The readability test determines the approximate grade level of the inputted text by using the Coleman-Liau index.

The program calculates the approximate grade level and will print "Grade X" were "X" is the grade level computed.

The Coleman-Liau Index formula:

index = (0.0588*L) - (0.296*S) - 15.8

where:
L = is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text.
  L = (total no. of letters in the text/total no. of words in the text)*100

S = is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text.
  S = (total no. of sentences in the text/total no. of words in the text)*100

round the index to get the approximate grade level and prints "Grade X"
